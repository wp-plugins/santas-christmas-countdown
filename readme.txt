Displays a cute Santa Claus Christmas Countdown in your sidebar. Use the shortcode [countdown] to display the countdown on any post or page. 

== Description ==

The Christmas Countdown Widget displays a cute Santa Claus counting down to Christmas in your sidebar. On Christmas day Santa displays a "Merry Christmas" greeting to your visitors. Since the countdown automatically updates each year and starts the countdown over again on the day after Christmas, you can leave it in your sidebar all year round if you want!

By the way... The Christmas countdown will appear in your sidebar on a transparent background so it looks good with any theme.

Now you can use the shortcode `[countdown]` to add the countdown to any post or page.
